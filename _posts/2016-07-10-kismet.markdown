[Kismet](https://www.facebook.com/HITWaustin/) has some really yummy Greek & Middle Eastern food, along with amazing veggie options. 

They also have two single-stall gendered restrooms. 

I talked to an employee at the end of last month, who was already aware of the issue. They took down my contact information, but informed me that the owner would be leaving town in a week. 

I haven't heard back from them, but will check in again in a couple of weeks. Switching signs isn't time consuming, but I realize it takes a while to research the issue.
