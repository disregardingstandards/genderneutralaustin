[Pinballz](https://www.facebook.com/PinballzArcade/) on Research only has two gendered restrooms, but don't let that stop you from choosing whichever you want.

Facebook Conversation with Pinballz:

Me:

> What is your policy on what restrooms people may use?

Spider House:

> Guests can use the restroom they are most comfortable with at our locations. The new location, Lake Creek, will have a family bathroom anyone can use by requesting a key, if someone wants another option.

You won't get in any sort of trouble for using one of their restrooms, but: 

* There are children there sometimes and parents may give you looks in the restrooms
