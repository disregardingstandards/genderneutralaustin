[Mage's Sancum](https://www.facebook.com/MagesSanctum/) is a really nifty shop in South Austin for all of your table-top gaming needs.

They had two single-stall restrooms that were gendered. I talked to them, and they ended up switching the signs out the next day, making them gender-neutral. 

This was first establishment that made the change after I talked to them, so it really motivated me to try it out on other places and document the process.

Everybody here has been more than pleasant.
