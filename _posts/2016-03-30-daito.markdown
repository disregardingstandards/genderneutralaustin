[Daito](https://www.facebook.com/daito2015/) is a Japanese restaurant on Guadalupe.

When I went there, they had two gendered single-stall restrooms.

A few days after talking with Management, they informed me that new signs have been purchased for their restrooms.

It's really neat knowing that a few minutes of conversation with people really does make a difference.
