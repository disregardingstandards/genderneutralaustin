There are no gender-neutral restrooms at [Spider House](https://www.facebook.com/spiderhousecafe/), both on the cafe side and ballroom. 

However, people can use whatever restroom they want, according to this conversation with Spider House on Facebook:

Me:

> What is your policy on what restrooms people may use?

Spider House:

> We don't have an official policy, but it's basically that we have all types of customers- straight, gay, trans, etc. they may use any bathroom they choose. It's never been an issue as Spider House is very welcoming to all.

> This is your turf, no matter how you identify.

I frequent Spider House, and I've never been told anything about using whatever restroom I want, there are some criticisms: 

* Customers might give you looks, walk out of the restroom to check the sign on the door, or leave
* People who work there tend to use gendered language to customers
