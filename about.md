# Why Are You Doing This?
As of January 15, 2015, Austin has some gender-neutral restroom laws, that you can read about [here](http://www.austintexas.gov/news/new-gender-neutral-sign-regulations-single-use-commercial-restrooms-are-effect-0).

They aren't enforced very often. From speaking to many establishment owners and managers, they don't even know about this regulation. 

We want to change that. 


# What We Do
We want people to feel safe and comfortable when using restrooms.

We do not want establishments fined for not following the regulations. That would only hurt how people advocating for gender-neutral restrooms are seen, and should be left as a last resort.

Even if an establishment doesn't have single-stall restrooms, we will still talk to them about their policies.
